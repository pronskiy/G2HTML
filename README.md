# What is it? 

Google Docs plugin that converts Google Doc to simple HTML that can be used in various blogs.

## Installation

To install this plugin, navigate [here](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/google_doc_to_html/807648787184)

Plugin versions <= 48 were deployed to the Chrome Web Store, as it was required by Google for Google Docs addons. 
Newer versions are deployed to the G-Suite Marketplace, as it's required by Google now. 
Old installations should be automatically updated to newer versions starting from 07.05.2020. 

## Migration

###  Versions <= 52 updated to the latest version:
a. You do hot have any custom templates in `g2html_settings.json` file:
   * Close all opened Google Documents
        * Open Google Drive and search for `g2html_settings.json` file
        * Delete it
    b. You have some custom templates in `g2html_settings.json` file:
        * Close all opened Google Documents
        * Open Google Drive and search for `g2html_settings.json` file
        * Download it from the Google Drive
        * Delete it on Google Drive
        * Open any Google Document and perform a single conversion.
        * Add your custom templates to the newly created `g2html_settings.json` file. 

  Without these steps 

## Configuration and folders

This plugin automatically creates the following files and folders:

* `G2HTML` folder to store generated HTMLs (so you can download them as a single file if you don't want to copy HTML contents via "Copy to clipboard" button)
* `g2html_settings.json` file where all plugin settings are stored and custom replacements can be configured (see the **Customization** section below).

## Markup reference

1. Text with `Consolas` font = `<code>text</code>`
2. `[d]Title[/d]` = `<p><a class="jb-download-button" href="some url"><i class="download-icon"></i>Title</a></p>`. Change `some url` to your IDE's download url in `g2html_settings.json`.
3. `[e]http://youtube_link[/e]` = `<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://youtube_link" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>`
4. `[more]` = `<!--more-->`
5. Select image → ⌘⌥Y → Set Alt or Description for image = `alt` attribute for image. 
6. Select image → ⌘K → Set link = `src` attribute of the image having this link.
7. `[html]<html>[/html]` = `<html>` part inserted into rendered HTML without any changes. Great for a custom markup.

Tip: you can define your own tags, see the **Customization** section below.  

## Working with images

The following workflow should be used to deal with images inside the Google Doc to use this plugin efficiently:

1. Upload various images to have final links
2. Insert them to Google Doc
3. Set alt and image link using the approach from **Markup reference** section
4. For GIFs: have the same name and links for the GIF preview and the GIF itself, e.g. upload them at the same time. Set only link to the GIF image itself and turn on `Generate | Gifs` in settings. After that, GIF player markup will be generated automatically. 

## General workflow

1. Write the Google Document
2. Execute Add-ons → Google Doc to HTML → Convert
3. Change settings if needed and press "Convert"
4. Empty warnings / errors list is displayed if everything is OK
5. List with warnings/errors is displayed if there are some problems. Click the warning or error description to navigate to the place in the document and fix it. Navigation uses bookmarks to jump to the specific place in the document (there is no other way to implement it), and as soon as warning / error is fixed, corresponding bookmark is removed.
6. As soon as all problems are fixed, copy rendered HTML to clipboard and paste it to the blog post.  

## Toolbar controls (from left to right)

1. Re-run conversion with previously selected settings
2. Open settings
3. Copy generated HTML to clipboard
4. Download generated HTML as HTML file
5. Help link

## Settings

### Generation

1. **Paragraphs** - wrap each paragraph in `<p></p>`.
2. **id attributes for headings** - automatically generate `id` attribute for `h` tags based on the tag content. You can add your own custom regexps for transforming heading content into id in `idtemplates` sections in `g2html_settings.json` file.
2. **Images** - generate image markup for images in Google Document.
3. **Gifs** - generate specific markup for GIFs (preview, JB-specific site markup), see **Working with images** section. 

### Transform

1. **Always make image width /= 2** - useful when you don't have images with @2x postfix. 
2. **Limit max image width to** - limits max image width to the specified value. 

### Inspections

1. **Image alts** - check if each and every `alt` image attribute is not empty
2. **404 errors (slow)** - tries to load the content for each url in the document (including images) and reports if there is a problem with loading the content. 
3. **Empty links** - shows errors for empty links.
4. **TODOs** - shows warning for every text or link containing `TBD`. Tip: if you don't want to insert the link to some resource right now, enter "TBD" instead of the URL. 
5. **Shortcuts** - detect shortcuts that do not have "Consolas" font (<code> tags) set. 
6. **Multiple spaces** - detect several spaces instead of a single one in text. 

Errors / warnings are displayed in the list. Each list item is clickable, click scrolls the document to the line / place with error. 

### Customization

To customize any settings that are not visible in the plugin UI, download the `g2html_settings.json`, edit it and replace your current settings file with it. After that plugin should use your own settings. 

### Settings reference

#### Generate

1. `paragraphs`. **Value**: `true` or `false`. Stores **Paragraphs** option.
2. `heading_ids`. **Value**: `true` or `false`.Stores **id attributes for paragraphs**.
3. `gifs`. **Value**: `true` or `false`.Stores **Gifs** option.
4. `generate_images`. **Value**: `true` or `false`. Stores **Images** option.

#### Transform 
5. `transform_image_width`. **Value**: `true` or `false`. Stores **Always make image_width /= 2** option.
6. `max_image_width`. **Value**: integer, default is 800. Stores **Limit max image width to** option.

#### Inspections
7. `image_alts`. **Value**: `true` or `false`. Stores **Image alts** option.
8. `fetch_links`. **Value**: `true` or `false`. Stores **404 errors (slow)** option.
9. `empty_links`. **Value**: `true` or `false`. Stores **Empty links** option.
10. `tbd`. **Value**: `true` or `false`. Stores **TODOs** option.
11. `shortcuts`. **Value**: `true` or `false`. Stores **Shortcuts** option.
12. `spaces`. **Value**: `true` or `false`. Stores **Multiple spaces** option.

13. `idtemplates`. Array of templates for replacing certain characters for header `id` attribute. Each template has the following format:
```json
{
     "regexp": "c\\+\\+", //escaped RegExp
     "replacement": "cpp" //text to insert instead of characters matched by regexp
}
``` 
14. `templates`. Array of templates for text transformations. First accepted template format:
```json
{
    "attributes": {
        "LINK_URL": true
    },
    "replacement": "<a href=\"LINK_URL\">$TEXT$</a>"
}
```
   Each text element in the Google Docs a) contains a text b) has some markup attributes (background color, foreground color, font family etc).
   `attributes` map contains key-value pairs. The key is one of the text [attribute names](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/attribute). Value is the value of this attribute. `<attribute>:null` pair means that there should be no such attribute for the text.
   `replacement` is the replacement markup to be inserted into the HTML. The `$TEXT$` variable contains the text of the text element. You can use various text attributes in the markup. To do that, just insert the text attribute name. 
    
   In the example above, we match all the text elements having non-empty link (`LINK_URL` attribute). In the resulting HTML, each of such elements is wrapped in `<a>` tag with a link from the `LINK_URL` attribute. 

   Second accepted template format:
```json
{
    "regexp": "\\[d\\](.*)\\[\\/d\\]",
    "replacement": "<p><a class=\"jb-download-button\" href=\"some url\"><i class=\"download-icon\"></i>$1</a></p>"
}
```
    
   `regexp` is a regular expression that matches the text of the text element. Nothing else, no attributes are accepted here. 
   You can define matcher groups and use them inside the `replacement` attribute. Example below shows how we can use the following custom text in our Google Document:
    
   `[d]Download My IDE![/d]`
    
   This text is transformed into the following HTML markup:
```html
    <p><a class="jb-download-button" href="some url"><i class="download-icon"></i>Download My IDE!</a></p>
```
    
**Suggestion**: as some typical text elements (like links) are handled by the general parser logic, it's not recommended to alter them via templates for now. There is no easy way to simplify the example above - the only way to have the correct template for you is to configure it once for your product. 
  
Checklist for custom templates:

1. Check regexp escaping.
2. Check if your json is valid at all.
3. If something does not work, please ping me. 

## Limitations

Sometimes bookmarks generated for errors are not removed from the document because of Google Docs bug.
